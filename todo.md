- make sure progression, cancel and back buttons have consistent color scheme. case in point: some buttons that move you forward are green (cleaning_quote), some are blue (schedule_job)
- move the single clear forward-moving-button to a footer (the way the schedule view looks)
- maybe the cards should have some consistent design theme (in the schedule view one card has a yellow background; maybe we should have something like that (maybe a light gray background) on all the cards?)
- we have a few ways of "leading" into a page. one of them is the title at the top of the page, and another is the header(1,2,3) element. i really want to get rid of those headers, or style them much more formally so they don't look like shortcuts.
- change address field on first job dialog to ask just for the user's zip code (this is based on the feedback alix and sam gave)
