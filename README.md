# A collaboratively designed worker cooperative

This repository is an early prototype of a worker-centric peer economy dispatch tool for mobile devices.

# Goals
I want this repository to be a potential starting point for people who want to run their own marketplaces for "gig work", with as many of the technical barriers removed as possible.
Ideally, I'd like this to be something that a non-technical person could "deploy to [Heroku/AWS/Azure]" in a few clicks.

At the moment, it's mostly a mock-up of the front end based on a few months of fieldwork and participatory design.
This project is (very) rough and could use a lot of help. 
More concretely, let's try and get the following done:

- Polishing visual assets and overall design
- Write up detailed instructions on how to build for Android, iOS.
- Write server side specs
- Implement server side APIs

*would be nice*

- Communications integration as a plugin (Twilio integration)
- Payments integration as a plug in (Stripe, Paypal, etc.)
